## About Meal Mate

Meal Mate is a class assignment for practice in using APIs in angular. We were tasked with picking an API that was useful and build a simple SPA that followed these requirements:

* Reads from an API, something useful
* Has and uses more than two components
* Uses routing to switch betwene pages
* Styled professionally 
    * Reponsive and maintains appela on all platforms
    * Styles written in SASS (or SCSS)
* Only uses Angular, no 3rd party libraries or frameworks
* Must be useful with sufficient depth

### The Idea
I chose to make a meal planning app that utilizes the Spoontacular food api. Spoontacular has a large API that has resources for ingredients, meals, recipes, etc. 

The idea was to make a meal planner where users could search with the Spoontacular API for meals based on various filters. The user could then click on the a meal, view its information, and add it to their favorite meals. They could also assign meals for days of the week on their calendar or calculate things like the calories for a meal.
